seems that there are 2 `tiny` implementations, first [developit/snarkdown](https://github.com/developit/snarkdown) then [commit-intl/micro-down](https://github.com/commit-intl/micro-down) (found via a [snarkdown pull request](https://github.com/developit/snarkdown/pull/18#issuecomment-382701991)).  

I adding both together here.
